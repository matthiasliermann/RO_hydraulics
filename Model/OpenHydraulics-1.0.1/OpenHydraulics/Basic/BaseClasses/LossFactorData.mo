This record defines the pressure loss factors of a pipe
segment (orifice, bending etc.) with a minimum amount of data.
If available, data should be provided for <b>both flow directions</b>,
i.e., flow from port_a to port_b and from port_b to port_a, 
as well as for the <b>laminar</b> and the <b>turbulent</b> region.
It is also an option to provide the loss factor <b>only</b> for the
<b>turbulent</b> region for a flow from port_a to port_b.
</p>
<p>
The following equations are used:
</p>
<pre>   &Delta;p = 0.5*&zeta;*&rho;*v*|v|
      = 0.5*&zeta;/A^2 * (1/&rho;) * m_flow*|m_flow|
      = 8*&zeta;/(&pi;^2*D^4*&rho;) * m_flow*|m_flow|
      = 1/(kinv*&rho;) * m_flow*|m_flow|
        Re = |v|*D*&rho;/&eta;

<ul>
<li> &Delta;p is the pressure drop: &Delta;p = port_a.p - port_b.p</li>
<li> v is the mean velocity.</li>
<li> &rho; is the density.</li>
<li> &zeta; is the loss factor that depends on the geometry of
     the pipe. In the turbulent flow regime, it is assumed that
     &zeta; is constant and is given by \"zeta1\" and
     \"zeta2\" depending on the flow direction.<br>
     When the Reynolds number Re is below \"Re_turbulent\", the
     flow is laminar for small flow velocities. For higher 
     velocities there is a transition region from 
     laminar to turbulent flow. The loss factor for
     laminar flow at small velocities is defined by the often occuring
     approximation c0/Re. If c0 is different for the two
     flow directions, the mean value has to be used 
     (c0 = (c0_ab + c0_ba)/2).<li>
<li> The equation \"&Delta;p = 0.5*&zeta;*&rho;*v*|v|\" is either with
     respect to port_a or to port_b, depending on the definition
     of the particular loss factor &zeta; (in some references loss
     factors are defined with respect to port_a, in other references
     with respect to port_b).</li>
 
<li> Re = |v|*D_Re*&rho;/&eta; = |m_flow|*D_Re/(A_Re*&eta;) 
     is the Reynolds number at the smallest cross
     section area. This is often at port_a or at port_b, but can
     also be between the two ports. In the record, the diameter
     D_Re of this smallest cross section area has to be provided, as
     well, as Re_turbulent, the absolute value of the 
     Reynolds number at which
     the turbulent flow starts. If Re_turbulent is different for
     the two flow directions, use the smaller value as Re_turbulent.</li>
<li> D is the diameter of the pipe. If the pipe has not a 
     circular cross section, D = 4*A/P, where A is the cross section
     area and P is the wetted perimeter.</li>
<li> A is the cross section area with A = &pi;(D/2)^2.
<li> &eta; is the dynamic viscosity.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The laminar and the transition region is usually of
not much technical interest because the operating point is
mostly in the turbulent regime. For simplification and for
numercial reasons, this whole region is described by two
polynomials of third order, one polynomial for m_flow &ge; 0 
and one for m_flow &lt; 0. The polynomials start at 
Re = |m_flow|*4/(&pi;*D_Re*&eta;), where D_Re is the
smallest diameter between port_a and port_b.
The common derivative
of the two polynomials at Re = 0 is
computed from the equation \"c0/Re\". Note, the pressure drop
equation above in the laminar region is always defined
with respect to the smallest diameter D_Re.
</p>
<p>
If no data for c0 is available, the derivative at Re = 0 is computed in such
a way, that the second derivatives of the two polynomials
are identical at Re = 0. The polynomials are constructed, such that
they smoothly touch the characteristic curves in the turbulent
regions. The whole characteristic is therefore <b>continuous</b>
and has a <b>finite</b>, <b>continuous first derivative everywhere</b>.
In some cases, the constructed polynomials would \"vibrate\". This is 
avoided by reducing the derivative at Re=0 in such a way that
the polynomials are guaranteed to be monotonically increasing.
The used sufficient criteria for monotonicity follows from:
